##### The exercise here tests the laying out of elements in the horizontal and vertical position using the display properties such as inline, block, and inline-block.

# CSS Display Property
 - This property defines how elements are shown in a website in relation to available width.
 - There are 4 key types of display:
 1. **Inline**: Here, the elements go into the same line until there is no more space.
 ```
 selector{
    display: inline;
 }
 ```
 2. **Block**: For this type, the element occupies the full available width without allowing other elements to fit in.
 ```
 selector{
    display: block;
 }
```
3. **Inline-block**: This is the combination of inline and block. The block allows the setting of height and width of elements while inline allows elements to fit on the same line.
```
selector{
    display: inline-block;
}
```
4. **None**: This hides the display of the element(s) in a web browser.
```
selector{
    display: none;
}
```
